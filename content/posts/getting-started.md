description: my first post of many

I started my coding journey nearly two months ago and I am amazed at how much
I've learned thus far. A very long road lies ahead because there's still so much
to learn but that's the fun part.

During my 45 minute commute back and forth to my normal job I've been listening
to the Code Newbie podcast and the I keep hearing the same advice: "blog about what
you are learning and it will help you internalize the concepts". So that's what
I'm going to do.

I plan post regularly about what I have learned recently in hopes to help myself
become a better developer.
