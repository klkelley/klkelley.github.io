description: Understanding the concept boundaries in software architecture  
--- 

The theme of "boundaries" has continued to make an appearance 
this past week for me. So I want to talk about boundaries
in the context of software architecture. 

You can draw boundaries around anything, even in software. Boundaries, in the general sense, help you create 
some type of separation of concern. 

Think about boundaries for a minute in terms of social norms. 
Social norms are rules (or boundaries) that are considered typical because most people 
in a society agree that they are reasonable ways to live. They lay out the basic guidelines 
for the roles we should play and how we should interact with others. Violating these norms 
(like picking your nose in public or standing way too close to someone) is considered deviant
behavior; its not considered acceptable. You probably don't think about social norms or 
boundaries too often in your daily life because for the most part they
are ingrained and inherent. That's not quite the case in software architecture, however. 


When you design software you want boundaries. If you think about it, in a way, you can construct your own type of "norms" in your applications. You want to prescribe rules and guidelines on how entities should or shouldn't interact. By doing this, you can achieve separation of concerns. 

As I've continued to think about boundaries in terms of software this week I kept thinking, What are considered "ideal" boundaries in software? 

I watched Robert Martin's talk on [Clean Architecture and Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZq8Jlq18Ec&t=806s) and he 
talks about characteristics of systems with ideal boundaries. They are systems that are: 

* Independent of Frameworks
* Independent of the UI
* Independent of the database
* Independent of any external agency. 



I'd agree all of this sounds very ideal but how is this all possible? It turns out, its largely comes
down to the direction of dependency. I'm going to refer to the diagram from Robert Martin as well simply
because it's a great visual representation and I couldn't seem to find anything that illustrated this idea better.

You can see these different layers and at the center are business rules and domain logic. Also
notice the direction of the arrows. This type of architecture suggests that dependencies can only point
inward. In other words, nothing in the center should know about anything on the outside of the circle. These
are the boundaries. 

The general idea here is that if you change anything in a particular layer, the layers directly underneath
it should not be impacted at all because they have no knowledge whatsoever of any external layers. This
allows us to have the type of independence mentioned above. 


Eventually though, you will come across a scenario where you have an inner layer that needs to call 
an outer layer. How do you handle that? A significant tool to implementing this architecture, not surprisingly, is the dependency inversion principle. By utilizing the DIP you can control the direction
of dependencies. You'd accomplish this by defining the interface in the innermost circle and having the outer layer implement the interface. This keeps your direction of dependency moving inwards! 


The type of data also matters. You don't want to pass along a special type of data along because that
means the inner layer will need to know something about the outer layer. You want to pass whatever is most 
convenient to the inner layer. This makes me think of my most recent project which involved 
using my Java HTTP server, Clojure TicTacToe, and a React front-end. I had to pass a data structure (which was representative of a board) to my Clojure TTT for various reasons (AI player, game logic, etc). I remember
thinking that I should pass along whatever is most convenient for the Clojure TTT application because
the TTT app does not know about anything outside of itself and I wanted to keep it that way. In the end, I 
was creating a **boundary**. 

The idea of boundaries and learning about software architecture in itself has really helped me 
make some crucial mental model connections and I'm really looking forward to applying and identifying
these concepts going forward.
