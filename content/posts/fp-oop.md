This week I watched Brian Goetz talk on [FP is Dead - Long Live FP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROL58LJGNfA) and I want to discuss
some of the main points he makes and things that resonated with me. 

Anyone who knows me know that I'm a big sports fan. I grew up watching and 
playing all types of sports. Brian makes an interesting yet valid comparison
about sports fans and how it relates to the FP vs OOP debate. 

Sports fans share many things in common: we're human, we like to wear our 
favorite team's jersey, we often drink beer at sporting events and 
participate in the "wave". In the end, differences aside, sports fans are 
lovers of sports! Yet, we rag on our team's rival including their fans. We 
love to hate our rivals - it's actually really interesting if you think about 
it. 

As humans, we tend to focus on differences so much so that we miss out on 
things we have in common. 


As you're likely aware - the same is to be said about functional programming 
and object-oriented programming. When I first entered the tech world, I often
heard people say something along the lines of "FP is better" or "OOP is 
better". I didn't understand it at the time - I always wondered what exactly 
made one better than the other and assumed it probably boiled down to that 
person's experience and/or personal preference. To be honest, I still don't
really get the reason for taking sides because after all, the language is a 
means to an end (casting aside pros/cons of the language). 

This is the point that Brian Goetz tries to hit home. Refer back to the quote
at the top of this post for a minute. Brian suggests that when we become
married to one tool, we're going to try to apply it everywhere; we're going
to distort our problem so that it fits into our idea. Not that it's a complete
parallelism but in a way this is likely also the [easiest](https://www.karakelley.me/2018/05/23/simple.html) path.

Instead of being married to a tool or paradigm, we should focus on being
a better programmer from **all paradigms**. We should learn FP. We should 
learn OOP. We should learn both vim and emacs. When we learn various paradigms
that allows us to approach problems with many ideas instead of one. We can 
decide which tool is **right** for this particular problem instead of taking 
a side. 

After all, the user doesn't care what language an application was written in. 
They don't care if it was a FP or OOP language. All they care about is if
the application works and is performant. 


At this point in my career, I haven't taken a side on FP or OOP for various 
reasons. But that isn't the point I'm trying to make. I think its important
to constantly assess your ideas and biases to ensure you can build the most
robust systems regardless of the tools. I think this approach can be applied
to many things in software outside of just languages.  

At the end of the day, Haskell, Clojure, Java, Ruby, COBOL, C++, Scala, 
Crystal, etc. are all languages. They're all tools that help us build 
beautiful software for our clients and our users.
